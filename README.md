# ShotLog
Creation and visualisation of logs for laser shooting experiments.

## Folder configuration

The GUI lets you manage cameras/sensors dynamically via **Folder list...** (per-folder expected/trigger flags and file definitions) and export/import the setup with **Save config...** / **Load config...**. See `CONFIG.md` for the JSON format and `Algo.md` for the core shot timing rules.
